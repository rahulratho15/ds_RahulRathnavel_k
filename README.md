Fear & Greed Market Sentiment Index

Both datasets were preprocessed and merged for analysis.

📊 Tasks Performed

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Sentiment alignment using timestamps

Feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualization of core insights

Statistical summaries & conclusions

PDF report generation

📦 How to Reproduce

Open the .ipynb notebooks in Google Colab

Upload the datasets OR mount Google Drive

Run all cells sequentially

Outputs will be stored in:

csv_files/

outputs/

ds_report.pdf

📝 Notes

All visualizations automatically export to the outputs/ folder

All processed/intermediate datasets export to csv_files/

The final PDF insight report is generated at the root level
